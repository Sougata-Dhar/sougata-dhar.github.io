My research interests are primarily in the areas of analysis and differential equations. In particular, I am interested in
<ul>
  <li>Lyapunov-type inequalities for linear and nonlinear differential/difference equations</li>
  <li>Existence of multiple solutions for differential/difference/fractional equations</li>
  <li>Eigenvalue problems for quasilinear differential equations</li>
  <li>Existence of positive solutions of Hammerstein integral equations</li>  
  <li>Fractional Laplacian in the Orlicz-Sobolev Space</li>
</ul>
