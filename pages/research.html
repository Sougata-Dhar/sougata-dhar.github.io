  <li>Lyapunov-type inequalities for linear and nonlinear differential/difference equations</li>
  <li>Existence of multiple solutions for differential/difference/fractional equations</li>
  <li>Eigenvalue problems for quasilinear differential equations</li>
  <li>Existence of positive solutions of Hammerstein integral equations</li>  
  <li>Fractional laplacian in the Orlicz-Sobolev Space</li>
</ul>

    <h3 class="mt-3">Lyapunov-type inequalities</h3>
    
    The Lyapunov-type inequalities plays an important role in the study of various problems
    related to the theory of differential equation such as oscillation, disconjugacy, 
    eigenvalue problems, etc. Due to its importance, the Lyapunov inequality has been
    improved and generalized in many forms of differential equations. We have 
    extensively studied the Lyapunov-type inequalities for several types of linear and quasilinear 
    differential equations with different types of boundary conditions. 
    In all the cases, we either sharpened the inequality or extended to a general platform.
    There are two important standpoint for this research. First, we were able to obtain the inequalities
    involving the positive and negative parts of a function, as compared to most results in the literature
    which involves the absolute value of the function. Thus we achieved much sharper inequalities 
    compared to the existing results.
    Second, we used the Lyapunov-type inequalities to obtain the existence and 
    uniqueness criteria for a nontrivial solution of a boundary value problem.
    In the future, we are interested to obtain results on nonlinear differential 
    equations and partial differential equations.

    <h3 class="mt-3">Existence of multiple solutions</h3>
    
    Difference equations or discrete versions of differential equations, 
    have been subject to much interest because of their numerous applications to the world including 
    statistics, computing, electrical circuit analysis, dynamical systems, biology, economics, and other 
    fields. Because of their numerous applications, the existence of solutions of difference equations 
    is a topic of extreme interest among the researchers. 
    Using the calculus of variation and critical point theory, we have established several sufficient criteria for the 
    existence of multiple solutions for some nonlinear difference 
    equations. At present, we are working on finding the sufficient criteria to ensure
    the existence of multiple solutions for a quasilinear ordinary differential equation.

    <h3 class="mt-3">On fractional differential equation</h3>
    In recent years, the subject of fractional calculus has gained considerable popularity 
    and importance due mainly to its demonstrated applications in numerous seemingly 
    diverse and widespread fields of science and engineering. It is a common practice to study
    the fractional differential equation with a pointwise boundary conditions (BCs) such as Dirichlet BC.
    However, the solutions are often singular due to the dependence at the left (right) endpoint. To relax this,
    we have introduced the fractional integral BCs. 
    These are different from the widely considered 
    pointwise conditions in the sense that they allow solutions to have singularities, and
    different from other conditions given by integrals with a singular kernel since they arise 
    from well-defined initial value problems.
    We have established the Lyapunov-type inequalities
    as well as sufficient criteria for the existence for multiple solutions for such a boundary value problem.
