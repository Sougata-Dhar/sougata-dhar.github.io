<h2 class="mt-3">About Me</h2>
<p align="justify">
    <!--Hello and welcome to my homepage.-->
    I am an Assistant Professor of Applied Mathematics at the 
    <a href="https://wit.edu/academics/computing-data-science" target="_blank">
    School of Computing and Data Science</a> 
    in the <a href="https://wit.edu" target="_blank">Wentworth Institute of Technology</a>.

    <br>

    <br>

    I completed my Ph.D. at the <a href="https://www.niu.edu/index.shtml" target="_blank">Northern Illinois University</a>
    under the supervision of Professor <a href="http://www.math.niu.edu/~kong/" target="_blank">Qingkai Kong</a> in 2017.
    I received my Masters in Mathematics from <a href="https://www.utrgv.edu" target="_blank">University of Texas Pan American</a> in 2011
    and my Bachelors from the Techno India of Saltlake, India in 2008. 
    Prior to moving to Wentworth, I had a 2-year postdoctoral position at
    the <a href="https://umaine.edu" target="_blank">University of Maine</a>
    and a 3-year postdoctoral position at the <a href="https://uconn.edu" target="_blank">University of Connecticut</a>.

    I work primarily in the intersection of analysis and differential equations.
    I enjoy having conversations about mathematical and functional inequalities and their applications to 
    differential equations. Lately, I started to look into nonlinear partial differential equations and eigenvalue problems.
    I am always happy to chat about my work and interested to know about my peers work. If you are interested, please feel free to to contact me.
    If you are a student and interested to work with me, please send me an email with your interest and background and we can
    have a conversation about that.

    Beside mathematics, I enjoy physical activities and traveling. 
    I have traveled to 42 states within the USA and I envision being a member of the <a href="https://allfiftyclub.com" target="_blank">50 state club</a> someday.  
    I am a strong believer of prioritizing mental health. Finally, I am a gastronomer and enjoy seafood the most. On that note,
    Italian and Japanese are two of my favorite cuisines- for me, distance is a mere number for fine cheese and delectable sushi! 
    Other than the food, I am passionate about dark roast coffee, perfume, and scotch. Cheers to that!
